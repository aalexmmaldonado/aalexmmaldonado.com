## Computational biology is highly interdisciplinary

Computational biology lies at the intersection of biology, computer science, and machine learning to analyze intricate biological data, model biological processes, and make predictive contributions to life sciences.
Data often involves genetic sequencing, host-pathogen interactions, and protein dynamics and modulation; thus, computational biologists require a deep understanding of biology.
The intersection with computer science is crucial for developing efficient algorithms and tools, employing programming languages and software engineering principles.
Machine learning also plays a key role.
Some of the largest computational biology advancements are from machine learning, and it is essential to grasp these principles to stay at the forefront of computational biology research.

## Broad sampling of major fields

I believe that by making this course a sampling of major fields of computational biology, you will gain a broad understanding of what is possible.
Additionally, by exposing you to a range of topics, I am helping you develop a diverse set of skills that will be useful in many different career paths.
Computational biology is a rapidly evolving field, and by providing you with a broad foundation, I am preparing you to adapt to new challenges and opportunities as they arise.

## Real-world scenarios enhance learning

As we delve into the realm of computational biology, I want to emphasize the practical relevance of each module.
Instead of a traditional approach, we'll be driven by motivating real-world scenarios that underscore the importance of the concepts you'll be learning. Consider yourself a problem solver in a scientific expedition, applying computational tools to tackle actual challenges faced in the field.
From predicting the impact of genetic variations on disease susceptibility to simulating the dynamics of biological systems under different conditions, our focus will be on tangible applications.
This approach ensures that what you learn in this course is not confined to theoretical frameworks but has direct implications for understanding and addressing complex biological phenomena.

## Outcomes

The following outcomes guides my design and implementation of this course.

1.  Develop a strong foundation in computational biology concepts and methodologies.
2.  Acquire practical skills in data analysis, modeling, and interpretation using Python.
3.  Understand genomic and transcriptomic analysis techniques and their applications.
4.  Explore the principles and techniques of computer-aided drug design.
5.  Gain hands-on experience in molecular simulations and structural analysis.
6.  Evaluate and apply computational methods to solve real-world biological problems.
7.  Prepare students for further research or applications in computational biology and related fields.
