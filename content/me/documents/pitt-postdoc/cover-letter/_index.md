I am writing to apply for the Postdoctoral Associate in Computational Biology position (Job \#23000205) in your department here at Pitt.
I am a Chemical Engineering Ph.D. candidate at Pitt and am scheduled to defend my dissertation on March 20th, 2023.
While different in name, my education and research experience have uniquely equipped me for computational biology research and teaching.

I obtained my B.S.E. in Chemical Engineering with minors in Biological Sciences and Mathematics from Western Michigan University, ensuring a transferable foundation in biology for this position.
Under Dr.~Brian Young, I contributed to developing a point-of-care immunodiagnostic device by crosslinking monoclonal antibodies using EDC to filter paper coated in electrically conductive carbon nanotubes.
The conductance/resistance of these devices would measurably change based on the test solution antigen concentration.
These experiences provided me with the necessary knowledge and skills to teach a broad range of topics in biology.

Knowing I wanted to pursue computational biology eventually, I joined Dr. John Keith's research group in computational chemistry as a Ph.D student here at Pitt.
This was a significant shift from my undergraduate experiences, but since joining the group, I have exponentially expanded my technical skills and interest in computational research.
My research focuses on establishing best practices for accurately and efficiently modeling challenging solvated reaction mechanisms detailed in my seven publications.
My research routinely uses quantum chemistry, classical force fields, molecular simulations, Python software development, and machine learning.
My Ph.D. has provided me with a robust, transferable, and complementary skill set for computational biology.

Teaching is a substantial portion of my graduate training and has significantly influenced my academic career trajectory.
I was a teaching assistant at Pitt for three semesters, receiving mentorship and hands-on experience that prepared me for a teaching-focused role.
Furthermore, as an instructor for INVESTING NOW, I refined my teaching philosophy and served the broader Pittsburgh community.

Your department's exceptional educational and research environment will provide the perfect setting to establish myself as a researcher and educator in computational biology.
My personal experiences and technical skills will allow me to excel as a postdoctoral associate and complement your highly interdisciplinary department.
Please contact me with any questions, and thank you for considering my application.
