Tenure track is a career path in academia that leads to a permanent faculty position, known as tenure.
Tenure is essentially a lifetime appointment at a university, providing job security and academic freedom to pursue research and teaching without fear of termination due to controversial ideas or external pressures.
In a sense, tenure can be interpreted as a form of part ownership of the university, similar to a partner in a law or accounting firm.

It is important to note that the tenure track system is primarily associated with research-intensive universities; in particular those classified as R1 (very high research activity) and R2 (high research activity) institutions under the [Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education](https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/).
These universities place a strong emphasis on research, and faculty members are expected to maintain an active research program and secure external funding.

When selecting an advisor, students should consider the tenure level of potential mentors and how it aligns with their own goals and expectations.
For example, an Assistant Professor may have more time and energy to devote to mentoring, but they may also be under pressure to secure funding and publish frequently.
On the other hand, a Professor may have a larger network and more resources, but they may have less time for one-on-one mentoring.

There are three primary levels of tenure-track positions: Assistant, Associate, and Professor.
Each level comes with different expectations, responsibilities, and implications for the research group's culture, mentorship, and goals.

### Assistant Professor

Assistant Professors are at the beginning of their tenure-track journey, focusing intensely on establishing themselves within the academic community in six years.
These faculty members are in the early phases of their academic careers, energetically working to establish themselves within their fields.
This period is marked by a concerted effort to develop a robust research agenda that will not only contribute significantly to their discipline but also lay the groundwork for their future academic endeavors.
Assistant Professors are primarily focused on three critical activities: securing funding, publishing prolifically, and building a research team.

One of the foremost priorities for Assistant Professors is to secure external funding to support their research initiatives. This process involves:

-   <u>Grant Applications</u> They diligently prepare and submit proposals to various funding agencies, such as federal organizations, private foundations, and industry partners.
    Crafting a compelling grant proposal requires a clear articulation of the research objectives, methodologies, and the potential impact of the work.
-   <u>Demonstrating Potential</u> Assistant Professors must showcase the viability and significance of their research ideas.
    This often includes presenting preliminary data or innovative concepts that can convince funding bodies of the project's merit.
-   <u>Building a Funding Track Record</u> Early success in obtaining grants can significantly enhance their reputation and make future funding opportunities more accessible.

For example, an Assistant Professor in environmental science might apply for grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to study the effects of climate change on coastal ecosystems.
By securing such funding, they can establish a laboratory, purchase necessary equipment, and support graduate students who will contribute to the research.

Establishing a strong publication record is essential for Assistant Professors aiming to build their reputation in the academic community. This involves:

-   <u>Research Dissemination</u> Conducting original research and publishing findings in reputable, peer-reviewed journals. Frequent publication helps in disseminating new knowledge and contributes to the advancement of their field.
