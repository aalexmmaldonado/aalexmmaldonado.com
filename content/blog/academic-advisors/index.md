Selecting the right academic advisor, is a crucial decision for undergraduate and graduate students embarking on research projects.
The advisor-advisee relationship is a critical factor in determining the success and overall experience of your research journey.
It is essential to find an advisor who not only aligns with your research interests but also provides the guidance, support, and mentorship necessary for your academic and professional growth.
Here, we will explore key considerations and strategies to help you effectively evaluate potential research groups and determine the best fit for your academic goals and aspirations.

## Understanding the Tenure Track and Its Implications

Tenure track is a career path in academia that leads to a permanent faculty position, known as tenure.
Tenure is essentially a lifetime appointment at a university, providing job security and academic freedom to pursue research and teaching without fear of termination due to controversial ideas or external pressures.
In a sense, tenure can be interpreted as a form of part ownership of the university, similar to a partner in a law firm or accounting firm.

It's important to note that the tenure track system is primarily associated with research-intensive universities, particularly those classified as R1 (very high research activity) and, to a slightly lesser extent, R2 (high research activity) institutions under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. These universities place a strong emphasis on research, and faculty members are expected to maintain an active research program and secure external funding.

When selecting an advisor, students should consider the tenure level of potential mentors and how it aligns with their own goals and expectations. For example, an assistant professor may have more time and energy to devote to mentoring, but they may also be under pressure to secure funding and publish frequently. On the other hand, a full professor may have a larger network and more resources, but they may have less time for one-on-one mentoring.

There are three primary levels of tenure-track positions: assistant professor, associate professor, and full professor.
Each level comes with different expectations, responsibilities, and implications for the research group's culture, mentorship, and goals.

### Assistant Professor

This is the entry-level position on the tenure track.
Assistant professors are focused on establishing their research program, securing funding, and building a strong publication record.
They are also expected to teach courses and mentor graduate students.
At this stage, the research group is typically smaller, and the advisor is more hands-on in mentoring and guiding students.

### Associate Professor

After achieving tenure, faculty members are promoted to associate professor.
At this level, they have demonstrated excellence in research with acceptable teaching and/or service.
Associate professors have more stability and can focus on evolving into the professor they actually want to be.
Joining labs near this transition could involve large shifts in group dynamics and mentorship.

#### Additional administrative roles

Associate professors take on more administrative roles, such as serving on committees or directing graduate programs; thus, they may have less time and energy to devote to their research group.
Additionally, associate professors may take on leadership roles in large, interdisciplinary research centers or consortia, providing access to resources and expertise that can further enhance the group's capabilities and impact.

#### Evolving research interests

Additionally, their research interests may evolve over time, leading to a shift in the group's focus and potentially attracting fewer new students.

On the other hand, an associate professor's research group may also experience growth and expansion.
With tenure comes increased stability and the opportunity to pursue larger, more ambitious research projects.
Associate professors may leverage their established reputation and network to secure more substantial funding, enabling them to support a larger team of graduate students, postdocs, and research staff.

Additionally, associate professors may shift their focus towards more collaborative or interdisciplinary research projects.
They may seek out new partnerships or engage in research that addresses broader societal challenges.
This shift in research direction can provide exciting opportunities for graduate students and postdocs to work on innovative, impactful projects that extend beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries.

#### Shifting priories

As associate professors navigate their career and personal lives, they may experience a shift in priorities that can significantly impact their research group and mentorship style.
Having achieved tenure, associate professors may find themselves reevaluating their goals and focusing on aspects of life that they may have put on hold during the intense pursuit of tenure.

One common shift is a renewed focus on family and personal life.
Associate professors may have young children or aging parents who require more attention and care.
They may prioritize spending more time with family, attending school events, or taking family vacations.
This shift in priorities can lead to a more balanced approach to work and a greater understanding of the importance of work-life balance for their students and research group members.

Another factor that can contribute to shifting priorities is burnout.
The pressure to secure funding, publish groundbreaking research, and maintain a high level of productivity can take a toll on associate professors.
They may find themselves feeling exhausted, emotionally drained, or questioning their passion for their work.
In response, they may seek to reduce their workload, delegate more responsibilities, or take a sabbatical to recharge and rediscover their enthusiasm for research.

Associate professors may also develop new personal interests or hobbies that they wish to pursue.
They may allocate more time to activities such as exercise, travel, or community involvement.
These outside interests can provide a fresh perspective and help them maintain a healthy work-life balance, ultimately benefiting their research group by modeling the importance of well-rounded lives.

While an associate professor's shifting priorities may lead to changes in the group's dynamics or mentorship style, it can also provide valuable insights and a more holistic approach to research and career development.
Ultimately, the key is to find an advisor who is transparent about their priorities and committed to supporting their students' growth and success, both academically and personally.

### Professor

This is the highest rank in the tenure track. Full professors are recognized leaders in their field, with a strong record of research, funding, and mentorship. They often have larger research groups and may take on more administrative roles, such as department chair or program director. Full professors have more flexibility in their research direction and can focus on long-term, high-impact projects.
