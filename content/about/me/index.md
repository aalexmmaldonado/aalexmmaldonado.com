You're here because you're considering me as an instructor, scientific collaborator, employee, or mentor.
Regardless of the role, I believe in presenting a complete picture of who I am.
In today's specialized world, it's easy to compartmentalize our professional identities.
But I've found that my diverse experiences and interests often contribute to unexpected insights and innovative solutions.
By sharing a holistic view of myself, I hope to give you a better understanding of how I might contribute to our potential collaboration or working relationship.
